<h2>Chess Question</h2>
<p>We are going to build a chess game. These questions are designed to specifically test your understanding of inheritance, scope, embedded loops, and if you can think in code.<br>
You'll be asked to use psuedo code, so the language isn't important.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provided in front of you is a list of classes we have used to start organizing the information needed to get started.<br>
    How would you complete the "piece class" and beyond?<br>
    <img src="img/classDiagram.svg" />
    <span>NOTE: If they complete the info for the piece class and stop, prod them to "keep going"</span>
    <div class="gradingCriteria">
      <h3>(GRADING CRITERIA)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>No subclasses present and needs lots of help</li>
          <li>With a little help, they list methods and attributes for "piece class" only (no subclasses present)</li>
          <li>They list subclasses but can't fill in all the methods and attributes.</li>
          <li>They list all related attributes and methods for piece class and subclasses for each piece and both players.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>To find where a player can move, we have started a method named "spotOccupiedByOpponent()" using pseudo code, complete the method:
      <pre>spotOccupiedByOpponent(intX, intY){<span>
        get Array of opponent's pieces
          forEach(opponent piece){
            get that piece's location
          if(opponent piece X === intX && opponent piece Y === intY){
            return true;
          }
        }</span>
      }</pre><br>
      <div class="gradingCriteria">
        <h3>(GRADING CRITERIA)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Can't write or explain how it works, even with help.</li>
          <li>Can explain how it works with a lot of help.</li>
          <li>Can write and explain with a little help.</li>
          <li>Can write and explain with no help</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
  </li>
  <li>We have begun another method to find the available moves for a Knight.<br>
    Using pseudo code, complete the method:
    <pre>availableMovesForKnight(){
      <span>get knightCurrentLocation;
        get howKnightMoves;
          (knightCurrentLocation + howKnightMoves) push each X,Y to moveableSpotsArray;
        forEach(moveable spot){
            if(spot is occupied by a piece of mine)
            remove from Array
          }
          return Array
        }</span>
    }</pre>
    <div class="gradingCriteria">
    <h3>(GRADING CRITERIA)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Can't write or explain how it works, even with help.</li>
        <li>Can explain how it works with a lot of help.</li>
        <li>Can write and explain with a little help.</li>
        <li>Can write and explain with no help</li>
